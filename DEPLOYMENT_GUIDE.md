# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Build Issues Fixed

The Supabase initialization errors have been resolved! The application now handles missing environment variables gracefully and will work in both development and production environments.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be pushed to a GitHub repository
2. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. **Environment Variables**: You'll need to configure these in Vercel

## üîß Environment Variables Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# SerpAPI Configuration (for web research)
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here

# Supabase Configuration (optional for demo mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### Optional Environment Variables

```bash
# Demo Mode (if you don't have Supabase set up)
DEMO_MODE=true
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Select the repository containing your AI SEO Content Agent

2. **Configure Project Settings**
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should be auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (should be auto-detected)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (should be auto-detected)

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - In the project settings, go to "Environment Variables"
   - Add each variable from the list above
   - Make sure to add them to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to configure your project

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Build Logs
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Check the build logs for any errors
- The build should complete successfully without Supabase errors

### 2. Test the Application
- Visit your deployed URL
- Try generating content with a test topic
- Verify that downloads work correctly

### 3. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test content generation
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/content/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "AI content generation",
    "content_purpose": "informational",
    "content_type": "blog",
    "audience": "developers",
    "tone": "professional",
    "seo_keywords": ["AI", "content"],
    "workspace_id": "demo-workspace",
    "word_count": 500
  }'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- **Supabase Errors**: These should now be resolved with the graceful fallback handling
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure all required variables are set in Vercel
- **Node Version**: Vercel automatically uses the correct Node.js version

### Runtime Errors
- **API Key Issues**: Check that your OpenAI and SerpAPI keys are valid
- **Database Errors**: The app will fall back to local storage if Supabase is not configured
- **CORS Issues**: Vercel handles CORS automatically for API routes

### Performance Issues
- **Cold Starts**: Vercel functions may have cold starts, but subsequent requests will be faster
- **Memory Limits**: The app is optimized to work within Vercel's memory limits

## üìä Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics
- Enable Vercel Analytics in your project settings
- Monitor performance and usage

### Function Logs
- Check function logs in the Vercel dashboard
- Monitor for any runtime errors

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Once deployed, Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy new versions when you push to your main branch
- Create preview deployments for pull requests
- Roll back to previous versions if needed

## üéØ Demo Mode

If you don't want to set up Supabase, the application will work in demo mode:
- Content will be saved locally (in memory)
- All features will work except persistent storage
- Perfect for demonstrations and testing

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Vercel build logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test locally first with `npm run build`
4. Check the browser console for client-side errors
