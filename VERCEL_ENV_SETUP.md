# 🔧 Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The application is currently running in "demo mode" because the environment variables from `.env.local` are **NOT** being loaded in Vercel production. This is causing:

- ❌ Database saves to be skipped
- ❌ SerpAPI research to fail
- ❌ OpenAI fallback to be used instead of real research
- ❌ Application to run in limited demo mode

## 📋 **Required Environment Variables for Vercel**

You **MUST** add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

### **1. OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### **2. SerpAPI Key (REQUIRED for real research)**
```
SERPAPI_KEY=your-serpapi-key-here
```

### **3. Supabase Configuration (OPTIONAL but recommended)**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

## 🔧 **How to Add Environment Variables in Vercel**

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project

### **Step 2: Navigate to Environment Variables**
1. Click on your project
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Click on **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

### **Step 3: Add Each Variable**
For each environment variable:

1. **Name**: Enter the variable name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
2. **Value**: Enter the actual value
3. **Environment**: Select **Production** (and optionally Preview/Development)
4. Click **Add**

### **Step 4: Redeploy**
After adding all variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Setup**

Once environment variables are properly configured:

✅ **Real-time Research**: SerpAPI will work for live web research  
✅ **Database Saves**: Content will be saved to Supabase  
✅ **Full Functionality**: All features will work as expected  
✅ **No Demo Mode**: Application will run in full production mode  

## 🔍 **How to Verify Setup**

After redeployment, check the logs for:

✅ `Supabase URL: https://your-project.supabase.co`  
✅ `Supabase Key length: 208`  
✅ `Research quality: real-time` (instead of "fallback")  
✅ No "Demo mode: Skipping database save" messages  

## 🚨 **Current Status**

Based on the logs, your application is currently:
- ❌ Running in demo mode
- ❌ Using OpenAI fallback research instead of SerpAPI
- ❌ Skipping database saves
- ❌ Limited functionality

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Redeploy** the application
3. **Test** with a simple topic to verify full functionality
4. **Monitor logs** to confirm real-time research is working

**Note**: The `.env.local` file only works in development. For production deployments, you must manually configure environment variables in the hosting platform (Vercel in this case).
